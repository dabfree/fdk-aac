# fdk-aac with DAB+ Support
Highly experimental - For audio processing control freaks!

Very kludgy, bad things will be done to this fork to try to identify possible areas to look at for improving the sound quality of the
encoder library for DAB+ broadcasting.

You are advised not to use it! If you must at least try not to compile it on anything you care about.

Best,

ODR Skunkworks.
